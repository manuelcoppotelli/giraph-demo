This repo contains the three Giraph Jobs presented during the *Giraph Tutorial*

- OutDegree: compute the out-degree for each vertex of the input graph
- InDegree: compute the in-degree for each vertex of the input graph
- PageRank: basic Pregel PageRank implementation

If you want to follow along the tutorial in the [``develop``](https://github.com/manuelcoppotelli/giraph-demo/tree/develop) branch you can find a basic template to start coding.

Otherwise in the [``master``](https://github.com/manuelcoppotelli/giraph-demo/tree/master) branch there is the complete **fully working** code.

You can find the related presentation on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/ManuelCoppotelli/apache-giraph-largescale-graph-processing-done-better).


Enjoy!
